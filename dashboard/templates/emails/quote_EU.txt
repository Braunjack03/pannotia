Ok, yes we can do that.

This area will look pretty cool when we add the depth contours.

Quote wise: (EU)
For a map size of 430mm x 430mm the price would be €355
For a map size of 600mm x 600mm the price would be €470
For a map size of 830mm x 830mm the price would be €812
Shipping will be approx  €50 - €80 within the EU. (we estimate duties/taxes to about ~€15/€20)

*Please note** For the largest size we will need to charge a special
courier fee due to the size and weight. We ask for your postcode and suburb
to quote for this.*


Your map will be framed and ready to hang and packaged in a handmade wooden
box.

Let me know* what size you are after* and we'll get started on the design
for your approval.

Kind regards, Tom
