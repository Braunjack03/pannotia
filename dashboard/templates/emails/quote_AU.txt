Ok, yes we can do that.

This area will look pretty cool when we add the depth contours.

Quote wise: (AUS)
For a map size of 430mm x 430mm the price would be $560
For a map size of 600mm x 600mm the price would be $740
For a map size of 830mm x 830mm the price would be $1280
Shipping will be approx $42-$78 within Australia.
Please note** For the largest size we will need to charge a special courier fee due to the size and weight. We ask for your postcode and suburb to quote for this.

Your map will be framed and ready to hang and packaged in a handmade wooden box.

Let me know what size you are after and we'll get started on the design for your approval.

Kind regards, Tom
