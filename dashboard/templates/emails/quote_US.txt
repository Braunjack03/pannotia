Ok, yes we can do that.

This area will look pretty cool when we add the depth contours.

Quote wise: (USA)
For a map size of 17.5" x 17.5" the price would be $440
For a map size of 24" x 24" the price would be $590
For a map size of 32" x 32" the price would be $980
Shipping will be approx $42-$78 within the USA.
Optional wooden gift box is $28
Please note** For the largest size we will need to charge a special courier fee due to the size and weight. We ask for your postcode and suburb to quote for this.

Your map will be framed and ready to hang.

Let me know what size you are after and we'll get started on the design for your approval.

Kind regards, Tom
